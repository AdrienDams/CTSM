assume the ctsm code base is checked out in $CTSM_ROOTDIR 

- to customize the generated namelist - edit the file
  > $CTSM_ROOTDIR/lilac_config/lnd_input.py

- to create the ctsm namelist FROM THIS DIRECTORY:
  > $CTSM_ROOTDIR/lilac_config/buildnml

- this will now create the files lnd_in, drv_flds_in, and clm.input_data_list in this directory
  THIS ONLY NEEDS TO BE DONE ONCE 
  to futher customize the lnd_in (say to adjust the ctsm history output) edit the generated lnd_in in this directory
