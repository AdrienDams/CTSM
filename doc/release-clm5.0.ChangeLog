One-line Summary: Bring in some simple fixes from ctsm1.0.dev006 and avoid glacier adjustment at startup from ctsm1.0.dev007

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Bring in a list of simple fixes that came to CTSM master. Also change so glacier initialization is *ALWAYS* done
at startup (time step zero) even if it isn't cold or interpolated initial conditions. Also synchronize some of the 
files in the doc directory with the files in ctsm/master.


CTSM Master Tag This Corresponds To: ctsm1.0.dev007 (minus ctsm1.0.dev005 and ctsm1.0.dev001)

Summary of changes:
-------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): 
- Fixes #340 (Avoid generating dynamic landunit adjustment fluxes for
  glacier changes in the first timestep)
- Fixes #24 (ncd_io_1d_log_glob is broken)
- Fixes #120 (Incorrect comments in Biogeophysics1Mod.F90
- Fixes #245 (Put all .gitignore entries in top-level file)
- Fixes #272 (Code should error on missing mxsoil_color when SOIL_COLOR
  is used)
- Fixes #283 (Add more helpful message about need to do init_interp with
  wrong number of vertical layers)
- Fixes #367 (For cmip6 runs: Turn on cpl hist output needed to drive a
  TG compset)
- Fixes #412 (Fix documentation of init_interp_method)
- Fixes #419 (Do not allow SOYFIXN diagnostic field with FUN)
- Fixes #465 (Remove backwards compatibility check for snw_rds)

One-line Summary: Fix some NFIX variables, update cime/cism for upgraded hobart new glade, new diagnostic fields, update cmip6 output

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Add some new diagnostic fields. Some needed for CMIP6. Update the CMIP6 user-mods output.
Fix a couple issues. Get full list of history tapes working correctly. Check for valid range
of CO2. New IC file interpolated from the previous one for f19_g17_gl4 for 2000 Clm50BgcCrop

Update cime and cism so can work on upgraded hobart. Also fix an issue that the Nag6.2 compiler found
in CTSM. Also get working with glade changes that happened on cheyenne, DIN_LOC_ROOT_CLMFORC was
changed to a new directory.

Nitrogen Fixation flux arrays were being set to missing value over non-vegetated landunits. This sets them to zero everywhere
and averages in the zero's at the gridcell level for history output. It also reads in restarts with missing values and converts
them to zero's.

There are also some tools updates, getting the tools working on the new upgraded hobart.cgd.ucar.edu.

And mksurfdata_map is updated to add some *_MAX files on the landuse.timeseries files that will allow us to conserve memory
for transient cases.

   #433 -- with hobart upgrade CTSM not working
   #435 -- intel build for tools
   #426 -- Nitrogen Fixation flux variables

One-line Summary: Second release branch tag for CESM2.0 release, fixing DA and tools and README files, identical to clm5.0.dev013

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

Update cime and cism to newer versions used in release. These bring in some answer
changes. The cime version updates the orbit for 2000 compsets. The cism version
changes answers for two fields with NO_EVOLVE and more fields for EVOLVE.

Fixes an important bug needed for use with Data Assimulation. Several changes
to testing. Adding wallclock as needed, changing a few compsets so science
supported compsets are used, added tput_tolerance to some tests known to be
variable.

Many changes to the clm tools for creating input files. Added the version by
querying "git describe" and adding it as an attribute to NetCDF files. Changes
to get tools working, and tested. Also changed so that tools can be run in either
a CTSM checkout or a CESM checkout.

Updated README files so they are accurate.

One-line Summary: First release branch tag for CESM2.0 release, identical to clm5.0.dev012

Purpose of this version:
------------------------

This is the first release branch tag for the CESM2.0 release for CTSM. There are many changes
to software mostly to fix a list of issues. There are some changes to the science that change
answers to fix some small problems, but don't have a large effect on simulations. Externals are
updated to new versions, fixing issues, and in most cases changing answers. The cime version
was updated and brings in some new features.

One-line Summary: Initial version of CLM5.0

This is the initial science version of CLM5.0.

Developments for CLM5.0 build on the progress made in CLM4.5. Most major components of the model have been updated with particularly
notable changes made to soil and plant hydrology, snow density, river modeling, carbon and nitrogen cycling and coupling, and crop
modeling.
The updates to CLM science are documented here:

https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/doc/build/html/tech_note/Introduction/CLM50_Tech_Note_Introduction.html#clm5-0

This version has production versions of CLM5.0 CMIP6 land-use change files for 1850, historical, and 2000. It has preliminary
versions of CMIP6 forcing files for Nitrogen deposition and population density. Further updates are needed for prescribed aerosols,
and future scenarios.

Spunup initial conditions are provided for several CLM physics and forcing combinations from simulations run at 1-degree resolution
(fv 0.9x1.25 with g1xv6 ocean mask).
