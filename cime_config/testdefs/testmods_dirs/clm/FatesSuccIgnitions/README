Testing the "successful ignitions" code, though reading the lightning
dataset. The lightning and successful ignitions datasets use the same
format and units, so handling is the same until you're in subroutine
area_burnt_intensity where for "successful ignitions" the model selects
currentSite%FDI = 1.0_r8
cloud_to_ground_strikes = 1.0_r8
while for lightning the model can use values < 1 for both.

Lara Kueppers (UC-Berkeley) has access to a "successful ignitions"
dataset for California that has not been placed in the repository of
CTSM datasets as of 2020/6/6. That dataset can be used with the
following settings:

fire_method = 'spitfire'
fates_spitfire_mode = 3
stream_fldfilename_lightng = '.../data_UCB/observed/CA_monthly_ignition_number_1980-2016/ignition_1980_to_2016_monthly_20190801.nc'
stream_year_first_lightng = 1980
stream_year_last_lightng = 2016
model_year_align_lightng = 1980

where {...} = /fs/cgd/data0/slevis on izumi and /glade/work/slevis on cheyenne.
