This test collapses unmanaged pfts to the 2 dominant ones to run the model
faster.

Collapsing pfts found in the surface dataset to a subset means that we need to
set check_dynpft_consistency = .false. to avoid the inconsistency between what
the model reads from the transient dataset and what the model "thinks" it read
from the surface dataset.

NB: This test is testing the 10x15 resolution only.
