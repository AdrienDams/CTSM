This test collapses unmanaged pfts to the 2 dominant ones and landunits
to the two dominant ones to run the model faster.

Collapsing pfts found in the surface dataset to a subset means that we need to
set check_dynpft_consistency = .false. to avoid the inconsistency between what
the model reads from the transient dataset and what the model "thinks" it read
from the surface dataset.

This test includes the settings of the decStart test so as to also test the
end-of-year transition since it's an IHist case and transient vegetation gets
updated every new year.

Currently CLMBuildNamelist.pm does not allow n_dom_pfts or n_dom_landunits > 0
in transient simulations and resets do_transient_pfts and do_transient_crops to
.false. for the run to proceed.

NB: This test is testing the 10x15 resolution only.
