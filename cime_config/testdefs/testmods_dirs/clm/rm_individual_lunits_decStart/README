This test keeps landunits with areas exceeding the correspondng
namelist thresholds and removes the rest. Simplifies the gridcell
representation for the purpose of running faster.

This test includes the settings of the decStart test so as to also test the
end-of-year transition since it's an IHist case and transient vegetation gets
updated every new year.

Currently CLMBuildNamelist.pm does not allow these landunit thresholds > 0
in transient simulations and resets do_transient_pfts and do_transient_crops to
.false. for the run to proceed.

NB: This test is testing the 10x15 resolution only.
