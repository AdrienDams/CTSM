Testing FATES cross grid seed dispersal is activated by enabling the 
namelist switch option use_fates_seeddisp as well as providing reasonable
values to the fates parameter file for the following variables:

fates_seed_dispersal_fraction
fates_seed_dispersal_max_dist
fates_seed_dispersal_pdf_scale
fates_seed_dispersal_pdf_shape

Given that the default fates parameter file has the above variables as unset,
a custom fates parameter file must be supplied to appropriately test this mode.

Addressing CTSM issue #2126 will provide the capability to build the fates parameter
file on the fly with the appropriate values for this test.  This testmod itself
addresses CTSM issue #2151.
