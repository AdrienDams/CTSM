This testmods directory is similar to the glcMEC_decrease testmods directory,
except
it allows the default setting of do_transient_crops, which now makes this
testmods directory the same as baseline's glcMEC_decrease testmods directory.

However, in the collapse2gencrop branch, do_transient_crops = .true.
while in the current baseline (ctsm1.0.dev008) do_transient_crops = .false.
